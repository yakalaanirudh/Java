/*
RULES

We can have a reference of abstract class but we cant have an object of anstarct class

An abstarct class cant be made final and vice versa

An abstract method cant be made final and vice versa

Abstract methods cant be made static

If a subclass is extending from an abstarct class then it must overwrite 
the abstarct classe's methods in the subclass for it to become a concrete class
